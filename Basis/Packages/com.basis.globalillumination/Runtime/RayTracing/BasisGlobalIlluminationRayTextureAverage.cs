/// Average colour of a base map or emission map, resolved per texture and cached until it goes stale.
/// A hit only carries a per-instance colour, so without this every textured surface would bounce its
/// material tint instead of what it actually looks like - and almost every lit material ships white.
/// The average is read off the smallest mip of a scratch copy, which works for compressed and
/// non-readable textures alike, so it costs one tiny async readback per unique texture.
///
/// The copy is a blit, and a blit is not something that can be issued while a render graph is being
/// recorded - which is exactly when the scene walk that asks for these averages runs. Requests are
/// therefore queued as they are asked for and drained once the frame's contexts have been submitted.
