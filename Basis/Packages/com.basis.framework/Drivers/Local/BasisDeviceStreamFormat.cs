    /// On-disk format ("BASISDVS") for a recorded VR device stream, plus the pure codec and the pure
    /// pose-reconstruction math that <see cref="BasisDeviceStreamRecorder"/> writes and
    /// <see cref="BasisDeviceStreamPlayer"/> replays.
    ///
    /// WHY THIS EXISTS. The IK suite has ~810 tests, a 109-clip CMU mocap corpus and 64 editor sweeps,
    /// and one limitation none of them can lift: nothing is verified in a headset. Mocap cannot supply
    /// three things only a real session has —
    ///   1. real controller ROTATION CONVENTIONS (the corpus NOTICE.md says it outright: "A mocap hand
    ///      is not a controller... A VR controller's rotation is a GRIP convention"; 27 hand-rotation
    ///      features shipped on mocap evidence and were wrong),
    ///   2. real tracker noise, stand-off, slip and dropout,
    ///   3. real calibration residual — this user's actual avatar/body mismatch.
    /// A recorded device stream supplies all three, because it IS a real session. Once it replays
    /// deterministically the in-headset verification debt stops being permanent: the session becomes a
    /// fixture like any mocap clip.
    ///
    /// WHY THE CALIBRATION BLOCK IS MANDATORY. The same device stream against a different calibration is
    /// a DIFFERENT INPUT — scale, per-device offsets and player height all sit between the tracker pose
    /// and the solved bone. A recording without them is not reproducible, so the calibration block is
    /// written unconditionally and <see cref="BasisDeviceStreamPlayer"/> compares it against the live
    /// calibration before it will claim a faithful replay.
    ///
    /// WHY THERE IS NO QUANTISATION. "Compact" stops exactly where bit-exactness begins. Quantising the
    /// poses would break the round-trip equality that the determinism test asserts, and a lossy fixture
    /// is a fixture that drifts against the code it is meant to pin. Poses are raw IEEE-754 float32.
    /// Compactness is bought back losslessly with the optional <see cref="BasisDeviceStreamFlags.DeflateBody"/>
    /// body compression instead, which cannot change a single decoded bit.
    ///
    /// SIZE. Header is a few hundred bytes. Each frame costs 16 bytes plus 58 bytes per device, so an
    /// 8-device session is 480 B/frame = 43.2 KB/s at 90 Hz = 2.59 MB/min = 155 MB/hour UNCOMPRESSED.
