    ///     supportBase  tracks  P.EyePos                      -- the HMD, which ORBITS the neck on a turn
    ///     pelvis       =  supportBase + R(torsoYaw) * (hips - eye)_tpose
    ///
    /// The eye is not on the neck's yaw axis: it sits ~9 cm in front of it. So turning your head sweeps
    /// the HMD sideways through an arc, the stance leash follows that arc within a frame or two
    /// (HeadBaselineFollowRateGain = 250), and the pelvis is carried along with it -- while the arm that
    /// is supposed to put the pelvis BACK under the body is rotated by the TORSO yaw, which deliberately
    /// lags the head (VSpineTorsoYawBlendSpeed = 8, and a 45 deg deadzone on desktop).
    ///
    /// The two only cancel when torsoYaw == headYaw. Every time they differ the pelvis is displaced by
    ///
    ///     |R(headYaw) - R(torsoYaw)| * |eye - neck|_xz  =  2 * 0.09 m * sin(lag / 2)

    ///
    /// This is the same class of bug -- and takes the same shape of fix -- as the phantom forward lean in
    /// BasisSpineGazeContaminationTests: a cue read off a point that ORBITS the joint it is meant to
    /// describe. There the answer was to reconstruct the NECK rigidly off the head so the lever arms
    /// cancel algebraically. Here it is the same reconstruction, applied to the stance leash: leash the
    /// yaw pivot, and measure the pelvis anchor arm from that same pivot. Both halves must move together
    /// or the cancellation is lost, which is why one strength (VSpineGazeSwingRemoval) drives both.
    ///
    /// ⚠️ PREMISE, stated up front: these gates model a head turn as an EXACT rigid orbit of the neck
    /// bone, the same premise BasisSpineGazeContaminationTests.GazeDown makes for a nod. A real turn is
    /// distributed through the cervical spine, so the true pivot sits somewhere between the neck and the
    /// skull and the real orbit is a little smaller than modelled. That makes these numbers an UPPER
    /// bound on the artefact -- it does not make the artefact conditional, because no pivot choice puts
    /// the HMD on the axis.
    ///
    /// ⚠️ VR ONLY, and the reason is worth knowing before changing the driver: BasisDesktopEye already
    /// pins its simulated eye onto the yaw axis on purpose ("this is what stops the eye's static forward
    /// offset ORBITING the neck every time you turn"), so a desktop eye has no arc to remove and
    /// de-orbiting one would INVENT the very slide these gates forbid. The driver therefore passes
