/// Avatars are in the structure as capsules on their bones, but the point every ray starts from comes from
/// the depth buffer - the avatar's real rendered surface. The two do not coincide, so a surface sitting
/// inside its own proxy fires every ray into the inside of that proxy and reads as fully enclosed. On feet
/// it is at its worst: the shin capsule ends at the ankle BONE, which is buried inside the shoe, so the
/// visible shoe around the ankle sits inside the capsule and comes out as a hard black disc.
///
/// A ray that starts inside a closed shape leaves it through a BACK face, so that is the whole test.
///
/// This is only sound because the mask restricts the trace to proxies: every hit here IS a capsule, so a
/// back face can only mean "started inside a body". Global illumination reaches the same conclusion by
/// reading a proxy flag off the instance it hit - it has an instance buffer and this does not, and running
/// the capsules as their own trace is what replaces it. Do NOT widen this mask: a back face on a double
/// sided wall or a leaf card is real occlusion, and stepping through those would delete most of the effect.
